## Assignment 1 - Mathamatical tables
### 1a 
Create a program that generates mathamatical tables from 3 to 10.                                                            
First, dont need to use for loops for creating the table.                   
Just hardcode the values. After you have done that,    
create a new file and use for loops here.                       
Here is the sample outputs for the first stage and the second one which we have to achieve:    
#### Stage 1
```
1 3 3 
2 3 6 
3 3 9
```
#### Stage 2 
```
1x3=3 
2x3=3
3x3=9
...
```

In Stage 2, the tables should have 10 items in them. We should also generate from the 3 table to the 10 table.
