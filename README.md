# Assignments

## Assignment 1 - Mathamatical tables
### 1a 
Create a program that generates mathamatical tables from 3 to 10.                                                            
First, dont need to use for loops for creating the table.                   
Just hardcode the values. After you have done that,    
create a new file and use for loops here.                       
Here is the sample outputs for the first stage and the second one which we have to achieve:    
#### Stage 1
```
1 3 3 
2 3 6 
3 3 9
```
#### Stage 2 
```
1x3=3 
2x3=3
3x3=9
...
```

In Stage 2, the tables should have 10 items in them. We should also generate from the 3 table to the 10 table.

## Assignment 2 - Simple calculator
### 2a
Create a simple calculator that accepts 3 imputs:   
1. First number    
2. Second number                                    
3. Operation (What we want to do with the numbers)                              

In the third input, if the user enters an asterisk we have to multiply those numbers.               
if the user enters a plus symbol, we have to add those numbers.                                     
if the user enters a minus symbol, we have to subtract those numbers.                               
if the user enters a slash symbol, we have to divide those numbers                        
And lastly, if the user enters something else other than these, we have to give a print saying "Oopsie! You have entered an invalid input!! Please try again!!!!!"
